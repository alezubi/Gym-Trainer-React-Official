// React Context API -> allows to define a context that is visible throughout our app
//    Essentially CONTEXT is GLOBAL STATE
//      1. Establish a Context
//      2. Wrap your components within the Context.Provider component
//      3. Pass the value of the state variable as a property to the Provider
//      4. In a component that needs access to the state of the context, use the useContext(ProviderName) hook
